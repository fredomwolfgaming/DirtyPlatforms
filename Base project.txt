Part 2: Implement the following:
-Some sort of item that the player can pickup (a coin or something). When the player touches the item, it should disappear from the level.
-A Game Instance that keeps track of how many items have been picked up and/or are left to pickup.
-A second level that the player is transferred to once they've picked up all the items.
-A "KillLine" or "KillZone" that will kill the player and restart the level if the player falls too low

i cheated on the game instance portion, but it operates the same as a Unity Game Manager component.
the bit i did was used the blueprint class for the coin/key/cone. 
every time you touch a key, 
it deletes that key, 
polls how many are still on the level, 
reports that new number, 
or if it's 0, then progresses to the next level.
