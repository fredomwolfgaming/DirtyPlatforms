Part 2: Implement the following:
-Some sort of item that the player can pickup (a coin or something). When the player touches the item, it should disappear from the level.
-A Game Instance that keeps track of how many items have been picked up and/or are left to pickup.
-A second level that the player is transferred to once they've picked up all the items.
-A "KillLine" or "KillZone" that will kill the player and restart the level if the player falls too low
